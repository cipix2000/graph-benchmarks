# Graph benchmarks #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This hosts a set of benchmarks meant to guide the design of a high performance graphing engine pipeline - think as fast as possible, sky is the limit.

### How do I get set up? ###

* checkout the files on your computer and point your browser to index.html
* if you want to test a browser that is running on a different device, you'll have to start a webserver that hosts the files.
* the easiest way to serve the files is to start a local server by typing node server/server.js in the repository folder. You need to have node installed. The webserver will listen on port 8000.
